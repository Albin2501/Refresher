## Grid ##

A grid may be selected and colored in. Selecting a singular cell or an area of cells will change the appearance to a randomized color. If cells of different colors are adjacent to each other, they then will acquire a different uniform color. See *flooding algorithm* for more information.

# Text Art #

Any given picture can be converted to ASCII art with a customizable resolution. Previous uploads can be revisited in a history log and copied to the clipboard to be shared anywhere. The original image is gray scaled and gamma corrected and then projected to a hand-selected scale of ASCII characters for the best results.
